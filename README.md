# How to host the game:
- press `~` to open the console
- type `listen` and press enter

# How to join the hosted game:
- press `~` to open the console
- type `open ${IpAddressOfTheHost}:7777` e.g. `open 127.0.0.1` for a locally hosted game (where no port needed) 

# Why create a "simplified" FPS C++ Template?
The provided C++ template that ships with the engine has several features that someone new to C++ may not be interested in like VR controls and Touch input. This code "bloats" the template to look a lot more complex than neccessary if you are simply looking to start with C++ in UE4. I'm using this project to create tutorials and you can use it in your own way!
